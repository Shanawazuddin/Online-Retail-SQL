# Retail Online Sales Analysis üìä

Welcome to the **Retail Online Sales Analysis** project! This repository demonstrates how SQL can transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights for a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. By analyzing sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance, this project provides valuable takeaways for sales strategy, inventory management, and customer engagement.

## üåü Project Overview

The dataset includes transactional data from **01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011** and contains key fields like:

- **INVOICE_NO**: Unique transaction ID  
- **CUSTOMER_ID**: Customer identifier  
- **QUANTITY**: Items sold in each transaction  
- **UNIT_PRICE**: Price per unit of the item  
- **INVOICE_DATE**: Date of the transaction  
- **COUNTRY**: Customer's location

This project answers critical business questions such as:
- **Which products drive the most revenue?**
- **Who are the most loyal customers?**
- **What are the seasonal trends in sales?**
- **Which countries contribute the most to sales?**

## üìÇ SQL Queries and Analysis

Below are the key SQL queries that analyze the retail sales data and generate actionable insights for the business.

### 1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**

**Check for missing critical data**:

```sql
USE RETAIL;

SELECT * FROM retail_online 
WHERE 
    QUANTITY IS NULL OR
    UNIT_PRICE IS NULL OR
    CUSTOMER_ID IS NULL;
```

**Standardize date format**:

```sql
UPDATE RETAIL_ONLINE
SET Invoice_Date = STR_TO_DATE(Invoice_Date, '%d-%m-%Y')
WHERE STR_TO_DATE(Invoice_Date, '%d-%m-%Y') IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 2. **Core Analysis Queries**

**Total sales per transaction**:

```sql
SELECT 
    INVOICE_NO, SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
FROM
    retail_online
GROUP BY INVOICE_NO;
```

**Best-selling products (by quantity sold)**:

```sql
SELECT 
    STOCK_CODE, SUM(QUANTITY) AS TOTAL_SOLD
FROM
    retail_online
GROUP BY STOCK_CODE
ORDER BY TOTAL_SOLD DESC;
```

**Revenue by product**:

```sql
SELECT 
    STOCK_CODE, SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS REVENUE
FROM
    retail_online
GROUP BY STOCK_CODE
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;
```

**Most frequent customers**:

```sql
SELECT 
    CUSTOMER_ID, COUNT(INVOICE_NO) AS TOTAL_ORDERS
FROM
    retail_online
GROUP BY CUSTOMER_ID 
ORDER BY TOTAL_ORDERS DESC;
```

**Sales by country**:

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNTRY, SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM
    retail_online
GROUP BY COUNTRY
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;
```

**Sales trends over time**:

- **Monthly sales trends**:

```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) AS MONTH, 
    CASE 
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 1 THEN 'January'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 2 THEN 'February'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 3 THEN 'March'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 4 THEN 'April'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 5 THEN 'May'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 6 THEN 'June'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 7 THEN 'July'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 8 THEN 'August'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 9 THEN 'September'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 10 THEN 'October'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 11 THEN 'November'
        WHEN MONTH(INVOICE_DATE) = 12 THEN 'December'
        ELSE 'Invalid Month'
    END AS MONTH_NAME,
    SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM RETAIL_ONLINE
GROUP BY MONTH, MONTH_NAME
ORDER BY MONTH;
```

- **Sales by day of the week**:

```sql
SELECT 
    DAYOFWEEK(INVOICE_DATE) AS DAY, 
    SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM 
    retail_online
GROUP BY DAY
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;
```

### 3. **Advanced Business Insights**

**Most expensive products sold**:

```sql
SELECT 
    STOCK_CODE,
    DESCRIPTION,
    UNIT_PRICE,
    SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM
    RETAIL_ONLINE
GROUP BY STOCK_CODE , DESCRIPTION, UNIT_PRICE
ORDER BY UNIT_PRICE DESC;
```

**High-value transactions**:

```sql
SELECT 
    INVOICE_NO, SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE)
FROM
    RETAIL_ONLINE
GROUP BY INVOICE_NO
HAVING SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) >= 1000;
```

**Products that have never been sold**:

```sql
SELECT 
    STOCK_CODE, DESCRIPTION
FROM
    RETAIL_ONLINE
GROUP BY STOCK_CODE , DESCRIPTION
HAVING SUM(QUANTITY) = 0;
```

**Sales conversion rate**:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(QUANTITY * UNIT_PRICE) / COUNT(DISTINCT INVOICE_NO) AS AVG_SALE_TRANS
FROM
    RETAIL_ONLINE;
```
