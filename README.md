## üåü Project Overview

The dataset contains transactional data from **01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011** and includes the following key fields:

- **INVOICE_NO**: Unique transaction ID  
- **CUSTOMER_ID**: Customer identifier  
- **QUANTITY**: Items sold in each transaction  
- **UNIT_PRICE**: Price per unit of the item  
- **INVOICE_DATE**: Date of the transaction  
- **COUNTRY**: Country of the customer  

This analysis answers critical business questions like:  
- **Which products drive the most revenue?**  
- **Who are the most loyal customers?**  
- **What are the seasonal trends in sales?**  
- **Which countries contribute the most to sales?**
